jib is a jitter for the brainfuck language (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

The main components are:
Jitter.cpp/.h : Main JIT engine. Handles the code and delegates to an Emitter (Emitter.h) to generate machine code.
Emitter.h : Interface definition for an emitter.
SimpleX86Emitter.cpp/.h : Emits VERY simplified x86 machine code. No optimizations, reads/writes to memory FAR too often.
OptimizedX86Emitter.cpp/.h : Emits "optimized" x86 machine code. Doesn't store unless it has to, etc.
main.cpp : Driver. Can be called with BF code on the command line, otherwise it jits a "Hello, world"-type program.

To compile:
> cd jib
> make

To run:
> ./jib
or
./jib ",.[,.]"
